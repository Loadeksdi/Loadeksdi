- 👋 Hi, I’m @Loadeksdi, in my last year of studies of Software and Information Systems at Efrei Paris, while working as an analyst developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, working out, listening to music and playing video games!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bleeding-edge technologies such as Deno TS, Rust, Svelte and plan to try Astro while working on a big personal project with Godot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find a 3 month-long internship in development as early as mid-march 2023 :)
- 📫 How to reach me: directly by mail, on LinkedIn or in my portfolio once it is finished https://www.loadeksdi.com/contact
